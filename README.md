### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm a Full Stack Python Developer, with 4 years of work experience, developing backend applications using Python(Flask, FaskAPI) and Flutter for front-end applications.

My mission is to learn and apply skills for developing and deploying software that will delight clients and make it easy for collaborators to contribute. 

I have worked on multiple projects from development to production:sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: and development to development:nerd_face::nerd_face:... 

Currently Planning To Contribute In The Flutter And FastAPI frameworks 

**How I Keep My Skills Sharp:**

I Use The Internet :blush:... Mostly [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9493356/skhendle) :wink: or [Grepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/profile/itchy-ibis-mob1ene7q4ls) :wink: for general issues(e.g How to convert int to string python) :satisfied::satisfied::satisfied:
